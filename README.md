Converting electronic diagram to breadboard

This project loosely aims at being a converter of electronic diagram encoded in scala to another diagram describing placement of electronic parts on solderless breadboard.  

For me, the motivation to start this project came from:
  * my long obsession with ciat-lonbarde designs, for example [rollz5 paper circuit](http://www.ciat-lonbarde.net/rollz5/index.html)
  * my poor soldering skills
